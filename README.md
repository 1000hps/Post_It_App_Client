# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a full-stack application that users can create their own posts with text and images and share posts with others.

Users can sign up/log in to their accounts, create and edit their posts, like other people's posts, and delete their own posts. It is a small
but fully functional CRUD app created by Ruolong Ren.

This application is available here: [Post-It-App](https://postitmern.netlify.app/).
